Worse still, greenhouse-gas emissions rose by 2.7% last year, the largest increase in seven years <a href=" https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612940/the-new-safer-nuclear-reactors-that-might-help-stop-climate-change/"> Click here for more</a> </div>

The worst rain fell in the mountainous central part of Puerto Rico, from the northwest to the southeast.

But a host of global climate models developed for the United Nations’s next major assessment of global warming, due in 2021, are now showing a puzzling but undeniable trend. They are running hotter than they have in the past.
